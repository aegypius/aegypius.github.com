title: Switched from Wordpress to Jekyll
categories: blog
---

Well, I don't post really often. Wordpress was a good choice 
when I started to work on some plugins (DA-Widgets, wp-lifestream, etc...).
But this week, due to my lack of interest and time, I get hacked.

Yeah, It's a shame :). A security issue was present on the Wordpress 
theme used in the eleventh version of [aegypius.com].

So, here come the twelfth version ! 

A complete u-turn in regards of web evolution. Let me explain this,
The 2 first version of [aegypius.com] was a blog written from scratch
with my hands and php3. Then I switched to [dotclear] for a few versions
and then [wordpress]. 

And now, I'm going to plain old html files...

But wait... I'm still a developer so I decided to do it with style !

So here is the components, I used : 
- [jekyll] : a static site generator written in ruby
- [disqus] : a global comment system 
- [jquery] : a javascript framework 
- [lesscss] : a very powerfull extension for css
- ... and some html :)

I hope you appreciate the work !
